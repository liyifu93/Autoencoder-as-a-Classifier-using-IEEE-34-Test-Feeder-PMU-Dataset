The following are the python files we used in the final project:

  1 - heatmap_generatorp.py was used to convert all .csv files to .png

  2 - train_idealmodel_grop4.py was used to train the ideal

  3 - train_nonidealmodel_22PMU_10dB_group4.py was used to train the 10dB white noise with 22PMUs non-ideal   model

  4 - train_nonidealmodel_22PMU_MissingOneData_10dB_group4.py was used to train the 10dB white noise and missing one data with 22PMUs non-ideal model

  5 - predict_group4.py was used to test all trained models on the interfered dataset

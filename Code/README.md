- The following are the python files we used in the final project:

    1 - heatmap_generatorp.py was used to convert all .csv files to .png heatmaps.

    2 - train_idealmodel_grop4.py was used to train the ideal.

    3 - train_nonidealmodel_22PMU_10dB_group4.py was used to train the 10dB white noise with 22PMUs non-ideal   model.

    4 - train_nonidealmodel_22PMU_MissingOneData_10dB_group4.py was used to train the 10dB white noise and missing one data with 22PMUs non-ideal model.

    5 - predict_group4.py was used to test all trained models on the interfered dataset.

- The folders are for the following:

    1 - Ideal_Model has all saved ideal models and figures we generated while training.
    
    2 - NonIdeal_Models has all saved non-ideal models and figures we generated while training.
    
    3 - PMU_PU has the dataset for training the ideal model.
    
    4 - Validation/AE_Train&Test has the datasets for training both non-ideal models.
    
    5 - Validation/Test_Model has the interfered dataset for testing the trained models.
